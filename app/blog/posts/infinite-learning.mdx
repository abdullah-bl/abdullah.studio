- Produce coherent micro courses across diverse topics
- Maintain consistent quality and format

After testing various models, I settled on a lightweight but capable LLM that could run via WebAssembly while still producing high-quality educational content.

### 2. Course Generation Pipeline

I built a sophisticated pipeline for course generation:

**Input Processing**: 
- Parse user topic and preferences
- Determine appropriate course complexity
- Set learning objectives

**Content Generation**:
- AI generates course outline
- Creates detailed content for each section
- Includes examples and practical applications
- Adds assessment questions

**Output Formatting**:
- Structures content into digestible sections
- Applies consistent styling and formatting
- Optimizes for mobile and desktop reading

### 3. User Interface Design

The interface needed to be simple enough that course generation felt magical:
- **Single Input Field**: Just type your topic and hit generate
- **Instant Feedback**: Loading indicators and progress updates
- **Clean Layout**: Focus on the generated content without distractions
- **Mobile Optimization**: Perfect for learning on the go

## Technical Deep Dive: Making AI Work in the Browser

### Course Generation Logic

The AI doesn't just generate random text - it follows a structured approach:

1. **Topic Analysis**: Understanding the subject matter and complexity
2. **Learning Path Creation**: Building a logical progression of concepts
3. **Content Generation**: Creating detailed explanations with examples
4. **Assessment Integration**: Including questions to reinforce learning

### Memory and Performance Optimization

Running AI in the browser requires careful resource management:
- **Lazy Loading**: Only load the AI model when needed
- **Memory Cleanup**: Proper garbage collection after course generation
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Graceful degradation for less powerful devices

## Challenges and Solutions

### Challenge 1: Model Size vs. Quality

**Problem**: Larger models produce better content but are slower to load and run.

**Solution**: I implemented model quantization and compression techniques, reducing the model size by 70% while maintaining 95% of the content quality. I also added progressive loading so users see immediate feedback.

### Challenge 2: Consistent Course Structure

**Problem**: AI can be unpredictable in output format and structure.

**Solution**: I developed a sophisticated prompt engineering system with strict formatting guidelines and post-processing validation to ensure every generated course follows a consistent, learnable structure.

### Challenge 3: Browser Compatibility

**Problem**: Different browsers have varying support for AI/ML operations.

**Solution**: I built a feature detection system that automatically chooses the best available method (WebGPU, WebAssembly, or fallback) for each user's browser and device capabilities.

### Challenge 4: Content Quality Control

**Problem**: Ensuring AI-generated educational content is accurate and helpful.

**Solution**: I implemented multiple validation layers:
- Content structure verification
- Fact-checking prompts within the AI pipeline
